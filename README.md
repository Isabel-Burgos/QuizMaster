# Quiz Master
Created quiz game application using Windows Forms (.Net Framework) in Visual Studio (Version 17.12.2).

The application is a Quiz Game where the player chooses an answer alternative and then continues to the next question. If no alternative is chosen before continuing to next question, this will count as a wrong answer.

## Game Setup
1. Start page -> allows user to start the game when ready
2. Quiz page(s) -> continues until all questions are answered
3. End page -> showing score and allowing user to end game

## Downloading Source Code
Clone repository and add as project in Visual Studio to continue development of the application.
